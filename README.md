# Archethic Wallet

Similar to a bank account for fiat currency, a crypto wallet is a personal interface for a cryptocurrency network that provides reliable storage and enables transactions. Whether a cryptocurrency is securely stored or not, much depends on the wallet, which is only as secure as its private keys.

Software wallets come in many forms, each with its own set of unique characteristics. Most are somehow connected to the internet and are hot in nature. Wallets are distinguished by a set of supported cryptocurrencies and software platforms such as Windows, Mac and other operating systems. Software wallets are available in three forms — desktop, mobile and online:
- Desktop wallets are computer programs that store cryptocurrencies on a PC so that its information is not accessible to anyone but the user, whose private keys are kept only on the desktop.
- Mobile wallets come in the form of a smartphone app and are easily accessible to their users at any time, considering most people don’t leave their homes without their phones. However, it is worth remembering that mobile devices are vulnerable to various malware and can be easily lost.
- Online wallets are web wallets that can be accessed from anywhere and any device, making them more convenient, but the private keys are stored by website owners rather than locally on user devices.

Archethic Wallet uses the standard bip39 protocol and uses a 24 words mneumonics for deriving private and public keys. If you are familiar with Metamask then Archethic Wallet is similar application for Archethic blockchain.

Archethic Wallet have features that are implemented:
- Use of 24 Words Mnemonics.
- Support for Multiple Languages
- Support for Multiple Currencies (Only views not as in multiple cryptocurrencies)
- Support for transactions (Sending and Receiving Tokens)
- Upcoming Support for NFTs and Many More
